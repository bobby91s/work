-function1 that asks and print the head in a doc.

-function2:
	-opens the file
	-makes an empty list
	-reads all the lines
	-searches for the lines that start with 'text='
	-new variable link = the lines striped of 'text='
		this is the line with the 2 links, added into 			one string
	-we split the 2 links and add them into a list called 
	ilink
	-once splitted we need to iterate through the list 		with a 'for' loop so that we can have each element 		independently
	-both links are now 2 strings in a list called 'ilink'


	-appeal to the function1 to fix the links
	-all lines are joined, and the content is reformed
	-command that writes the content in the file
	
-funtion3:
	-searches in the directory to find the file with 	 crawljob in it's name and appeals to funtion2

-statement that appeals to function3
