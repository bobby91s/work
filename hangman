""" Create a program that simulates the hangman game; set a number of tries
and if the user guesses then add the letter to the blanks

How to: 

- create a variable with some words, then let the program randomly
choose one for the game
- after the word has been chosen make the program print the word, with ' _ ' instead of the letters in the word
- create a new list with the given letters
- while tries > 0:
    - ask the player to input a word and iterate through the new list to see if the 
    letter can be found, if not, tries minus 1, else print the letter instead of the ' _ ' symbol
- if tries = 0 then print Game over, and print out the missing letters
- if the player manages to guess out the word, print out 'Good Job, you won!' """
